<!-- Instructions 
As users playing a two player game we want to:

- enter our names and have them displayed
- have our order chosen for us by the game
- take turns placing our marks in empty spaces
- not be able to place our marks in an occupied space
- be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw
- start the game over without having to reset the browser
- As a user playing a one player game I want to:

see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent
have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space
As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board
set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3)
